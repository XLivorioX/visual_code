om told us about his new job, and Jim told us about his new girlfriend.
 After a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. 
 I went to bed late that night, but I was very happy.
On Saturday morning I went running in the park.
 I ran 5 kilometers, and then came home.
After that, I met my girlfriend for lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant near my house.
 I love Thai food!
I spent the evening with my girlfriend, watching TV on the sofa.
